  <introduction>
    <p>
      An <term>algebraic function</term> is a function that can be defined using a finite number of operations that can only include elementary arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and powers representing roots and repeated multiplication (rational powers).
      Functions we worked with previously include polynomials, which are perhaps the simplest class of functions after linear functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to work with these functions, we need to have a common framework of understanding.
      This first section of chapter 4 is organized with the following explanatory sections before the examples and explorations:

      The book includes two key tables.
      The first (Definition 4.1) is about the <em>meaning</em> of exponents.
      The second (Theorem 4.2) is about the <em>properties</em> of exponents.
      In reality, these two are closely related.

    </theorem>
    
    <p>
      For <em>positive integer</em> exponents, the powers literally mean <em>repeated multiplication</em>, as given in the Definition part (a).
      The properties in the Theorem parts (a-e) are <em>consequences</em> of this definition as long as all of the resulting exponents are still positive integers.
      The definition for <em>negative integers</em> and for zero is then exactly what we need for the Theorem properties (a-e) to remain true for <em>any</em> integers, particularly to work with property (d) when <m>b \gt a</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The definition for the <em>roots</em> given in Definition part (b) is chosen as a <em>consequence</em> of Theorem property (c).
      That is, a root <m>\sqrt[k]{x}</m> has the meaning that when this number is raised to the power <m>k</m>, we obtain the value <m>x</m>.
      If we wanted to write that root as a power <m>\sqrt[k]{x} = x^r</m> where we didn't know <m>r</m> in advance, property (c) would require
      <me>
        x = (\sqrt[k]{x})^k = (x^r)^k = x^{rk}.
      </me>
      In order for this to be true, we require <m>rk = 1</m> so that <m>r=\frac{1}{k}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I emphasize this mainly to use this as an illustration of what often happens in mathematics.
      We often start with a mathematical idea working with a particularly simple case.
      In our example, we know what we meant by a power that is a positive integer.
      We determine some properties that work for that simple case.
      Then, by looking at what happens following the rules created by the discovered properties, we are able to expand our ideas from the simple case to something more complex.

    <p>
      So what do I want you to take away from this section?
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Simplify products and quotients involving powers.
            Pay attention to the difference between <m>x^a x^b = x^{a+b}</m> and <m>(x^a)^b = x^{ab}.</m>
            In the same way, know the difference between <m>\frac{x^a}{x^b} = x^{a-b}</m> and <m>\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)^a = \frac{x^a}{y^a}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Be able to deal with negative exponents.
            Naturally switch between division by <m>x^p</m> and multiplication by <m>x^{-p}</m>.
            Similarly, division by <m>x^{-p}</m> is the same as multiplication by <m>x^{-(-p)} = x^p</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            When roots are involved, be able to switch between thinking in terms of roots and in terms of powers. Note that the domain of <m>x^{p/q}</m> is based on whether <m>q</m> is even or odd, where <m>q</m> even requires a value <m>x \ge 0</m>. This means that <m>x^{2/3}</m> and <m>x^{4/6}</m> have different domains even though <m>\frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{6}</m>. For <m>x \gt 0</m>, they will be the same.
