  <introduction>
    <p>
      An <term>algebraic function</term> is a function that can be defined using a finite number of operations that can only include elementary arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and powers representing roots and repeated multiplication (rational powers).
      Functions we worked with previously include polynomials, which are perhaps the simplest class of functions after linear functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to work with these functions, we need to have a common framework of understanding.
      This first section of chapter 4 is organized with the following explanatory sections before the examples and explorations:

      The book includes two key tables.
      The first (Definition 4.1) is about the <em>meaning</em> of exponents.
      The second (Theorem 4.2) is about the <em>properties</em> of exponents.
      In reality, these two are closely related.

    </theorem>
    
    <p>
      For <em>positive integer</em> exponents, the powers literally mean <em>repeated multiplication</em>, as given in the Definition part (a).
      The properties in the Theorem parts (a-e) are <em>consequences</em> of this definition as long as all of the resulting exponents are still positive integers.
      The definition for <em>negative integers</em> and for zero is then exactly what we need for the Theorem properties (a-e) to remain true for <em>any</em> integers, particularly to work with property (d) when <m>b \gt a</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The definition for the <em>roots</em> given in Definition part (b) is chosen as a <em>consequence</em> of Theorem property (c).
      That is, a root <m>\sqrt[k]{x}</m> has the meaning that when this number is raised to the power <m>k</m>, we obtain the value <m>x</m>.
      If we wanted to write that root as a power <m>\sqrt[k]{x} = x^r</m> where we didn't know <m>r</m> in advance, property (c) would require
      <me>
        x = (\sqrt[k]{x})^k = (x^r)^k = x^{rk}.
      </me>
      In order for this to be true, we require <m>rk = 1</m> so that <m>r=\frac{1}{k}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I emphasize this mainly to use this as an illustration of what often happens in mathematics.
      We often start with a mathematical idea working with a particularly simple case.
      In our example, we know what we meant by a power that is a positive integer.
      We determine some properties that work for that simple case.
      Then, by looking at what happens following the rules created by the discovered properties, we are able to expand our ideas from the simple case to something more complex.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what do I want you to take away from this section?
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Simplify products and quotients involving powers.
            Pay attention to the difference between <m>x^a x^b = x^{a+b}</m> and <m>(x^a)^b = x^{ab}.</m>
            In the same way, know the difference between <m>\frac{x^a}{x^b} = x^{a-b}</m> and <m>\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)^a = \frac{x^a}{y^a}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Be able to deal with negative exponents.
            Naturally switch between division by <m>x^p</m> and multiplication by <m>x^{-p}</m>.
            Similarly, division by <m>x^{-p}</m> is the same as multiplication by <m>x^{-(-p)} = x^p</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            When roots are involved, be able to switch between thinking in terms of roots and in terms of powers. Note that the domain of <m>x^{p/q}</m> is based on whether <m>q</m> is even or odd, where <m>q</m> even requires a value <m>x \ge 0</m>. This means that <m>x^{2/3}</m> and <m>x^{4/6}</m> have different domains even though <m>\frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{6}</m>. For <m>x \gt 0</m>, they will be the same.

  <subsection xml:id="subsec_factoring_division_remainder">
    <title>Factoring, Division and Remainders</title>
    <p>
      In order for the next subsections of the book to make sense, we need to remember that the most significant reason for factoring formulas is to solve equations.
      If we can rewrite an equation so that it is of the form <m>A \cdot B = 0</m>, meaning the equation is rewritten as a product of two factors being equal to zero, the only way this can happen is if one of the factors is equal to zero.
      This allows us to create two simpler equations each equal to zero.
      We then see how to solve the simpler equations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, I want to remind you of the first time you learned about factors.
      This would have occurred before you learned about algebra.
      It would be in terms of factoring integers.
      The number 3 is a <term>factor</term> of 12 because you can evenly divide 12 by 3.
      That is, <m>12 \div 3</m> is another integer, <m>12 \div 3 = 4</m>.
      But the number 5 is <em>not</em> a factor of 12 because when you try to divide <m>12 \div 5</m>, the answer is not an integer.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what did we do when division didn't work out evenly?
      Before you might have learned about decimal values, you would have learned about division with <em>remainders</em>.
      If you took 12 items and attempted to form five equal groups,
      you would discover that you could make 5 equal groups with 2 items per group, but there would be 2 more items left over.
      We would say 12 divided by 5 is 2 (the size of each group) with a remainder of 2 (the amount left over).
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathematically, division and remainders is really a statement about multiplication and addition.
      Asking us to find <m>12 \div 5</m> means to attempt to find the value so that <m>5 \cdot \square = 12</m>,
      and the <m>\square</m> is the size of the group.
      We couldn't quite do this evenly, so we have to modify the equation to include addition of the remainder:
      <me>12 = 5 \cdot 2 + 2</me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will be taking and applying this same concept to polynomials.
      When we take a polynomial <m>p(x)</m> and divide it by another polynomial <m>q(x)</m>, we are generally going to think of this as asking us to find a new polynomial <m>m(x)</m> (the multiple) so that
      <me>
        p(x) = q(x) \cdot m(x)
      </me>.
      Usually, this won't be possible to do exactly, so we need a remainder,
      <me>
        p(x) = q(x) \cdot m(x) + r(x).
      </me>
      Polynomial division is the process of finding these two polynomials.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will save the actual process of polynomial division for another reading.
      Instead, we want to focus on what happens if there is no remainder.
      In that case, we have <m>p(x) = q(x) \cdot m(x)</m>.
      We have <em>factored</em> the original polynomial into two simpler polynomials.
      So division is really another way of thinking about factoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The textbook points out that we often want to look specifically for factors of the form <m>q(x)=x-c</m>, which I will call an <term>elementary linear factor</term>.
      What happens if we attempt to divide a polynomial <m>p(x)</m> by <m>x-c</m>?
      If there is no remainder, then we have found a simple factor,
      <me>
        p(x) = (x-c) \cdot m(x)
      </me>
      where <m>m(x)</m> is a polynomial with a degree smaller by 1 than the degree of <m>p(x)</m>.
      It will be like we have just peeled off one factor of the polynomial.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we do find <m>p(x) = (x-c)\cdot m(x)</m>, notice that <m>p(c) = 0</m>.
      That is, the value of <m>c</m> in the elementary linear factor is a zero (or root) of the original polynomial.
      We can guess these elementary linear factors of polynomials by looking for the zeros on a graph.
    </p>
    <p>
      The textbook also introduces a theorem called The Integer Root Theorem that gives us a limited number of possible values for the roots to be rational numbers (simple integers or fractions). I will not be focusing at all on the Integer Root Theorem, but I state it here for your information.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm-integer-root">
      <title>Integer Root Theorem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>p(x)</m> be a polynomial of degree <m>n</m>,
          <me>p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0</me>,
          where all of the coefficients <m>a_i</m> are integers and <m>a_0 \ne 0</m>.
          The only possible integers are those values that are integer factors of <m>a_0</m> (either positive or negative).
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      If you like this type of result, there is also something called the Rational Root Theorem that says the only possible rational numbers <m>a/b</m> that can be roots of a polynomial will have <m>a</m> a factor of <m>a_0</m> (the constant term) and <m>b</m> a factor of <m>a_n</m> (the leading coefficient).
