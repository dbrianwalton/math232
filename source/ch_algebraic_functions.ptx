  <introduction>
    <p>
      In Math 231, you learned the fundamentals of calculus.
      Specifically, you learned about the concepts of the limit and the derivative.
      When working with actual examples, you focused primarily on elementary algebraic functions like simple polynomials.
      Now that we have this basic foundation, we will look at more complex algebraic functions while we review the ideas of calculus.
