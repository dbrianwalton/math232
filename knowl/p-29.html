<p>So what do I want you to take away from this section?</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Simplify products and quotients involving powers. Pay attention to the difference between <span class="process-math">\(x^a x^b = x^{a+b}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((x^a)^b = x^{ab}.\)</span> In the same way, know the difference between <span class="process-math">\(\frac{x^a}{x^b} = x^{a-b}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)^a = \frac{x^a}{y^a}\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Be able to deal with negative exponents. Naturally switch between division by <span class="process-math">\(x^p\)</span> and multiplication by <span class="process-math">\(x^{-p}\text{.}\)</span> Similarly, division by <span class="process-math">\(x^{-p}\)</span> is the same as multiplication by <span class="process-math">\(x^{-(-p)} = x^p\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>When roots are involved, be able to switch between thinking in terms of roots and in terms of powers. Note that the domain of <span class="process-math">\(x^{p/q}\)</span> is based on whether <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> is even or odd, where <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> even requires a value <span class="process-math">\(x \ge 0\text{.}\)</span> This means that <span class="process-math">\(x^{2/3}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x^{4/6}\)</span> have different domains even though <span class="process-math">\(\frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{6}\text{.}\)</span> For <span class="process-math">\(x \gt 0\text{,}\)</span> they will be the same.</p></li>
