<p>So what did we do when division didn't work out evenly? Before you might have learned about decimal values, you would have learned about division with <em class="emphasis">remainders</em>. If you took 12 items and attempted to form five equal groups, you would discover that you could make 5 equal groups with 2 items per group, but there would be 2 more items left over. We would say 12 divided by 5 is 2 (the size of each group) with a remainder of 2 (the amount left over).</p>
