<p>In order for the next subsections of the book to make sense, we need to remember that the most significant reason for factoring formulas is to solve equations. If we can rewrite an equation so that it is of the form <span class="process-math">\(A \cdot B = 0\text{,}\)</span> meaning the equation is rewritten as a product of two factors being equal to zero, the only way this can happen is if one of the factors is equal to zero. This allows us to create two simpler equations each equal to zero. We then see how to solve the simpler equations.</p>
