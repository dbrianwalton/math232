<p>I emphasize this mainly to use this as an illustration of what often happens in mathematics. We often start with a mathematical idea working with a particularly simple case. In our example, we know what we meant by a power that is a positive integer. We determine some properties that work for that simple case. Then, by looking at what happens following the rules created by the discovered properties, we are able to expand our ideas from the simple case to something more complex.</p>
